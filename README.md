# JARVIS
This was my attempt to make a voice assistant similar to JARVIS (in iron man movie)
Let's be honest, it's not as intelligent as in the movie, but it can do a lot of cool things and automate your daily tasks you do on your personal computers/laptops.
# Features

It can do a lot of cool things, some of them being:

* Greet user
* Tell current time and date
* Launch applications/softwares
